Homework 4

This is a Game of Thrones trivia game created with JavaScript and jQuery to test a true GoT fan!

When a user clicks the "Start" button, a timer set to 75 seconds will start and they'll be prompted to answer five multiple choice questions that even bandwagon GoT fans will know. After choosing an answer, a user must click the "Submit" button before clicking the "Next" button to move onto the next question. If the answer is wrong, 15 seconds will be deducted from the timer and the text color will turn red. If the answer is correct, the answer will turn green.

At the end of the quiz, the user will be able to click "Check Answers" and submit their score to a High Score table to show off their GoT knowledge! Have fun and good luck!
