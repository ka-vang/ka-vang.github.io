# Unit 10 OOP Homework: Template Engine - Employee Summary

A great way to introduce a software engineering team is to create an application where team members' basic information are displayed in a simple format that's easy to read. Sometimes, you don't want to have to read through one's entire biography just to find out what their email address or GitHub usernames are. Instead, you just want to be able to do a quick search and be able to pull up that information. That's why this Node CLI application was created!

As a manager, this Node CLI application will take in information about employees and generate an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. This is a quick and easy way to easily show who's on the software engineering team, what their roles are, and how to get a hold of them. This application will allow an unlimited number of engineers and interns to be added so if you have a big team, there won't be any issues adding them all.

This is a simple command line application so it's also extremely user friendly. The application will prompt the you for information about the team manager and the team members. When you're done adding team members, choose "No additional team members" and the HTML will be automatically generated. Good luck and have fun putting your team together!
