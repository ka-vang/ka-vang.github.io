Homework 3

This is a random password generator created with JavaScript to create a password that includes:

    - 8-128 characters

    - Special characters

    - Numeric characters

    - Lowercase characters

    - Uppercase characters

When a user clicks the "Generate Password" button, they'll be prompted to choose what they want the length of their password to be. The minimum is 8 and the maximum is 128. If a user enters below or more than what's allowed, they'll get an alert to tell them to choose between 8-128 characters. When the user fixes this error and enters a number between 8-128, the user will be prompted to confirm that the password will include special characters, numeric characters, lowercase characters, and uppercase characters. Once the user goes through all the prompts, they'll receive a randomly generated password that meets all the criteria.

As a bonus, the user will also be able to copy this password by clicking the "Copy to Clipboard" button. When they do that, an alert will pop up to confirm that the password has, indeed, been copied. The user will then be able to paste the newly generated password anywhere they like.
