# Homework 15: Update Portfolio

Hello! My name is Ka Vang and I am a Full Stack Developer located in Minneapolis, Minnesota. I design and develop websites and web applications using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Programming allows me to free my creative mind so I can continue to challenge myself and grow. Currently, I am an IT Specialist and although I enjoy working in the IT field, I realized that my passion is in programming. As a student, I have gained a strong foundational knowledge in web development and my hope is that as I continue on this journey, I will only become a more creative and skilled developer.
