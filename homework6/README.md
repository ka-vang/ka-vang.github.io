# Unit 06 Server-Side APIs Homework: Weather Dashboard

This weather API application will allow users to be able to enter a city in the search bar and be able to see the city's:

    * current weather
    * weather conditions
    * an image icon of the current weather conditions
    * wind speed (m/s)
    * humidity percentage

Users are also able to see the upcoming 5 day forecast as well so they can plan better for their week or vacation. One great tool about this application is that all the cities searched are stored on the local storage so users can see which cities they've already looked up.
