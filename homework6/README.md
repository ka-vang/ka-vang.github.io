# Unit 06 Server-Side APIs Homework: Weather Dashboard

Are you planning to visit a city but want to know how to pack your luggage according to the weather? Let this weather application assist you with your planning! This weather API application will allow users to be able to enter a city in the search bar and be able to see the city's:

    * Current weather
    * Weather conditions
    * An image icon of the current weather conditions
    * Wind speed (m/s)
    * Humidity percentage

You'll also able to see the upcoming 5 day forecast as well so you can plan better for their week. One great tool about this application is that all the cities searched are stored on the local storage so users can see which cities you've already looked up. This will save you time so you don't have to wonder if you've already searched for San Diego's weather. Happy planning and safe travels!
