      <p id="intro1">Hello! My name is Ka Vang and my passion in IT is in programming. I am currently working as an IT Specialist with the Minneapolis VA Health Care System but will be starting a new position with the
        City of Minneapolis as an Applications Programmer. Something fun about me is that I love adventure! I have skydived twice in my life, tandem. I would love to be able to skydive indepently one day.
        I have also bunjee jumped at 450 feet in Costa Rica and it was absolutely <strong>AMAZING</strong>!!! I would do it again in a heartbeat. As you can probably already tell, I love the outdoors. I enjoy camping,
        fishing, hiking, and recently just started golfing. Another one of my passions is music. I taught myself how to play the piano and guitar. I am no pro and still have a lot to learn but I play enough to 
        write and sing my own songs. Over the years, music has saved me and gotten me through some of the hardest times in my life. I do not just hear it. I feel it. I taste it. It is something I would not be able to
        live without. We often are asked what our "why" is and my "why" are my children, Peyton and Jada. Because of them, I now understand what it means to love unconditionally.
