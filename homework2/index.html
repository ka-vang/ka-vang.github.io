          <p id="intro1">Hello! My name is Ka Vang and my passion in IT is in programming. I am currently working as an IT Specialist with the Minneapolis VA Health Care System. I graduated from the University of Minnesota with a
          Bachelor's Degree in Psychology in 2007 and in 2015, I graduated with a Master's Degree in Information Technology with an emphasis in Information Security from Walden University. As part of the curriculum, some of my
          classes included learning programming languages such as JAVA, HTML/PHP, SQL, and more. Although I found those classes to be challenging, I found that enjoyed them just as much. That was when I realized programming is
          the path in IT that I wanted to pursue.
            
          <p id="intro1">Something fun about me is that I love adventure! I have skydived twice in my life, tandem. I would love to be able to skydive indepently one day. I have also bunjee jumped at 450 feet in Costa Rica and it was
          absolutely <strong>AMAZING</strong>!!! I would do it again in a heartbeat. As you can probably already tell, I love the outdoors. I enjoy camping, fishing, hiking, and recently just started golfing.
          </p>

          <p id="intro1">Another one of my passions is music. I taught myself how to play the piano and guitar. I am no pro and still have a lot to learn but I play enough to write and sing my own songs. Over the years, music has
            saved me and gotten me through some of the hardest times in my life. I do not just hear it. I feel it. I taste it. It is something I would not be able to live without. We often are asked what our "why" is and my "why"
            are my children, Peyton and Jada. Because of them, I now understand what it means to love unconditionally.
