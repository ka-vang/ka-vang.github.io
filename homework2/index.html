          <p id="intro1">Hello! My name is Ka Vang and my passion in IT is in programming. I am currently working as an IT Specialist with the Minneapolis VA Health Care System. I graduated from the University of Minnesota with a
          Bachelor's Degree in Psychology in 2007 and in 2015, I graduated with a Master's Degree in Information Technology with an emphasis in Information Security from Walden University. As part of the curriculum, some of my
          classes included learning programming languages such as JAVA, HTML/PHP, SQL, and more. Although I found those classes to be challenging, I found that enjoyed them just as much. That was when I realized programming is
          the path in IT that I wanted to pursue.
            
          <p id="intro1">Something fun about me is that I love adventure! I have skydived twice in my life, tandem. I would love to be able to skydive indepently one day. I have also bunjee jumped at 450 feet in Costa Rica and it was
          absolutely <strong>AMAZING</strong>!!! I would do it again in a heartbeat. As you can probably already tell, I love the outdoors. I enjoy camping, fishing, hiking, and recently just started golfing.
          </p>

          <p id="intro1">Another one of my passions is music. I taught myself how to play the piano and guitar. I am no pro and still have a lot to learn but I play enough to write and sing my own songs. Over the years, music has
          saved me and gotten me through some of the hardest times in my life. I do not just hear it. I feel it. I taste it. It is something I would not be able to live without.
          </p>

          <p id="intro1">Finally, we are often asked what our "why" is. Why do we wake up before sunrise and come home after sunset to put food on the table? Why do we seek to continuously improve ourselves? For a long time, I 
          struggled answering that question. I felt like a robot following societal orders: Graduate high school, go to college, get a decent job, and contribute to society. It wasn't until I became a mother that I'm finally able to 
          answer that question. Because of them, I now understand what it means to love unconditionally and how to live with purpose. They have given me a reason to work harder than ever because I want them to grow up one day and say, 
          "My mom was one heck of a woman."
